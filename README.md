# My nightmare, it all stems from childhood
Game created in libGDX for the course TDP024 @ LiU 2017. 
It is not done, but the basic things are here. 

## Problems with the code
The current state of the code the player dosent move correctly. I was playing around with force for the player (mainly to get jumping working) but something is messed up. The player is more of sliding as on ice. 

### Not handling player damage
Code will just log the collision with enemies. But that would be pritty easy to implement. 

### What to do with this
Well this will not be updated after the course ended, so you will not get a full game ever. But it you want 
a sample project to look at this could be it. I think the state of the code is pritty decent. Please do enjoy!
